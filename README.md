## Project Title
UI Based Prim's Algorithm


## Problem Statement
Create a portal [GUI] in which user can upload excel files or a CSV file which contains the data of the connected graph in a manner [vertex1, vertex2, edge weight]. The portal should be able to display the original graph long with the minimum spanning tree graph using Prim's algorithm.
 

## Why is this particular topic has been chosen?
This topic is chosen because Prim's algorithm is significantly faster in the limit when you've got a really dense graph with many more edges than vertices. So working on this project helped us in understanding the Prim algorithm in a better way by making its user interface and along with that helped us in learning R which is a Data science language in this project to make a user interface so that project can be scaled in the future.

# Objective and Scope of the Project

### Objective
Our objective is to find the minimum cost spanning tree using a Prim’s Algorithm.

### Scope
Our project can be used to study for ways to lay out electrical networks in a way that minimizes the total cost of the wiring. In a minimum spanning tree, all the nodes(houses) would be connected to power by wires in a way that has minimum cost and redundancy (cutting any wire necessarily cuts the power grid into two pieces.)
It can be also used to generate mazes. Prim’s algorithm has been used this way for creating high-quality mazes.
